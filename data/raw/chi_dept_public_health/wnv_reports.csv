Surveillance
This is the first report on arborviral surveillance in Chicago for 2018. This first report provides data on week 23
of surveillance for West Nile virus (WNV) in mosquitoes and includes data on other surveillance indicators.
Gravid traps were placed throughout Chicago and monitored twice during this first week. During this first
week of surveillance, two mosquito pools tested positive for WNV.

Dead Birds: To date, 1 dead bird has been collected. Test results for the sample are pending.
Human cases: 0
Risk Assessment
Although there is an early season indication of WNV, it is not uncommon to detect virus at a low level in early
spring due to its ability to over winter in Culex females. The risk of human WNV infection in Chicago is low.
Larval and Adult Mosquito Control Efforts
The City of Chicago larvicide project began treatments on May 21. Over 35,000 catch basins in the public way
were treated. This project will continue for the next few weeks.

Surveillance
The City’s arboviral surveillance continued last week and all collected mosquitoes were tested in-house for
West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis Encephalitis (SLE). Trap counts remained low in comparison to last year’s
collections. Four (4) additional trap locations collected WNV-positive mosquitoes and one trap was positive
for a second week in-a-row. These collections contained a combination of Culex pipiens and Culex restuans
mosquitoes. Due to low infection rates in these samples, the risk for WNV transmission remains low.

The\r\nnumber of reported human cases was 49, more than triple the number reported in 2015. A\r\nprincipal factor contributing to this increase was a much higher average temperature.\r\nLarviciding\r\nPre-season larviciding was conducted in areas that have greater historic prevalence of\r\ndisease. Pre-season larviciding was a cooperative venture between the Department of Public\r\nHealth, Department of Family and Support Services, Westside Health Authority and sister\r\nagencies. In total, over 115,000 catch basins were treated with Altosid ® XR - Briquets, meant\r\nto inhibit the development of larvae into adults. To evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts,\r\na total of 2,760 catch basins were sampled. Of these, 337 (12%) had larvae recovered of\r\nwhich 150 (46%) had adult emergence.\r\nEnvironmental Surveillance\r\nEighty-three gravid traps were placed throughout the city and mosquitoes were collected on a\r\ntwice-weekly basis from June – September. All mosquito species were identified and\r\nrecorded, and female mosquitos of the Culex genus were tested for both West Nile virus and\r\nSt. Louis encephalitis. The total number of mosquitoes collected was 49,784, of which 36,776\r\nwere female Culex species. Of these, a total of 2,029 mosquito pools were prepared and tested,\r\nof which 463 (22.8%) were positive for WNV (none were positive for St. Louis encephalitis). In\r\ncomparison, 25,034 mosquitoes were collected during the same period in 2015, only 6.5% of which\r\nwere positive for West Nile virus. Additionally, a total of 4 birds were collected and tested. Of\r\nthese, 2 were negative and 2 were found unsuitable for testing.\r\n                                             Chicago Department of Public Health\r\nWest Side Center for Disease Control <U+F09F> 2160 W.

In comparison, 16\r\ncases, of which 3 were fatal, were reported in 2015.\r\nAdulticiding\r\nAdulticiding was conducted when an area showed a vector index greater than 1 for two\r\nconsecutive weeks. Prior to adulticiding, a press release was issued, aldermanic offices were\r\nnotified, and door hangers were distributed (some 12,000 in total). Adulticiding occurred on\r\nnine separate occasions, covering 27 wards and 427.4 linear miles, using Zenivex ®.\r\nSurveillance for Aedes Mosquitoes\r\nUp to four BG Sentinel traps were placed at one time to monitor for the presence of Aedes species\r\nthe vector for Zika virus, including at or near residences of human Zika virus cases. Mosquitoes were\r\ncollected and identified as per the protocol for Culex species. A total of 4,492 Aedes albopictus\r\nmosquitoes were collected from one trap located near a tire recycling facility; no Aedes species\r\nmosquitoes were collected from any of the other traps. Larviciding, adulticiding and the removal of\r\ntires were all implemented to address this situation.\r\nFor WNV surveillance data in Illinois: Illinois Data\r\nFor national WNV surveillance data: National Data\r\nFor more information on WNV: Environmental Health Homepage\r\nFor U.S. Climate data: NOAA National Overview\r\n                                                   Chicago Department of Public Health\r\nWest Side Center for Disease Control <U+F09F> 2160 W.
